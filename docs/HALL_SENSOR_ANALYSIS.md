# Hall Sensor Analysis

## Test Results:
- **100 RPM** → 1800 pulses/second → **1080 pulses/revolution**
- **1000 RPM** → 18000 pulses/second → **1080 pulses/revolution**

## Conclusion:
This is NOT a simple Hall sensor - it's a **HIGH-RESOLUTION QUADRATURE ENCODER**!

## Typical Encoder Resolutions:
- **360 PPR** (1 pulse per degree)
- **720 PPR** (0.5 degrees per pulse)  
- **1080 PPR** (0.33 degrees per pulse) ← **YOUR ENCODER**

## What This Means:
- **3x more resolution** than typical 360 PPR encoders
- **Perfect for precise RPM control**
- **Can detect very small speed changes**
- **Great for closed-loop control**

## Next Steps:
1. **Test A/B quadrature signals** (if available)
2. **Implement RPM calculation** from pulse rate
3. **Add closed-loop speed control**
4. **Use for precise winding control**

## GPIO 22 Analysis:
- **Currently reading:** High-frequency pulses (1080 PPR)
- **Signal type:** Digital encoder output
- **Frequency:** Up to 18kHz at 1000 RPM
- **Perfect for real-time control**
