Looking at the analysis from doc CODEBASE_ERRORS_FOUND.md, 
COMPREHENSIVE_ERROR_ANALYSIS.md, and klipper_achitechture.md

 Needs Improvement:

Hardware timer ISR (currently using software timer)
Bisect algorithm in StepCompressor
Complete G1 command implementation
Error recovery mechanisms

Recommended Next Steps

Implement Hardware Timer ISR

Use RP2040 hardware timer
Set to 20kHz frequency
Ensure atomic operations


Complete StepCompressor

Implement Klipper's bisect algorithm
Add velocity spike detection
Optimize chunk boundaries


Finish G-code Implementation

Connect G1 to StepCompressor
Add proper feedrate conversion
Implement coordinate transformations


Add Safety Features

Endstop monitoring in ISR
Emergency stop handling
Stall detection
