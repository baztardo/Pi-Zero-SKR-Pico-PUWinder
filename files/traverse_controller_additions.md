# ADDITIONS TO TRAVERSECONTROLLER

## Add to traverse_controller.h (in public section):

```cpp
public:
    // ... existing methods ...
    
    /**
     * @brief Stop step generation without disabling motor
     * Used when MoveQueue takes over control during winding
     */
    void stop_steps();
```

## Add to traverse_controller.cpp (at end of file):

```cpp
// =============================================================================
// Stop Steps - FOR MOVEQUEUE HANDOFF
// =============================================================================
void TraverseController::stop_steps() {
    // Stop generating steps but DON'T disable the motor
    // This allows MoveQueue ISR to take over control
    moving = false;
    steps_remaining = 0;
    homing = false;
    
    // DON'T touch GPIO pins - MoveQueue will control them
    
    printf("[TraverseController] Step generation stopped (MoveQueue takeover)\n");
}
```

## Why This Is Needed:

When winding starts, we need to:
1. Tell TraverseController to stop calling `generate_steps()`
2. But NOT disable the motor (that would set ENA=1)
3. Let MoveQueue take full control of the GPIO pins

The `stop_steps()` method does this by:
- Setting `moving = false` (so `is_moving()` returns false)
- Clearing `steps_remaining` (no more steps to generate)
- NOT touching the GPIO pins (MoveQueue keeps control)

Then in main.cpp:
```cpp
if (traverse_controller && traverse_controller->is_moving()) {
    traverse_controller->generate_steps();  // Only runs when homing
}
```

During winding:
- `is_moving()` returns false
- `generate_steps()` is NOT called
- MoveQueue ISR has full control
- Motor stays enabled via MoveQueue

During homing:
- `is_moving()` returns true
- `generate_steps()` IS called
- TraverseController controls motor
- Works normally
