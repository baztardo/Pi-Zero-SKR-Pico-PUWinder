## 📊 Current State Analysis

### ✅ Strengths
- **PIO Implementation**: Hardware-accelerated stepper control with GPIO handoff
- **Robust Safety**: Emergency stops, position validation, queue overflow protection
- **Klipper-Inspired**: Real-time velocity matching, step compression
- **Config-Driven**: Centralized parameter management
- **Multi-Interface**: UART, USB, Web control options

### ⚠️ Identified Issues

#### 1. Queue Robustness Problems
- **Duplicate Start Procedures**: Multiple `sync_traverse_to_spindle()` calls causing queue conflicts
- **ISR Starvation**: Single-step-per-ISR limits max speed to ~20kHz
- **Memory Corruption Risk**: No bounds checking on queue operations
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Limited error recovery from queue overflow

#### 2. Performance Bottlenecks
- **ISR Overhead**: 20kHz max step rate (vs theoretical 125kHz PIO capability)
- **Sync Frequency**: 250ms minimum sync interval limits responsiveness
- **CPU Load**: Main loop competing with ISR for processing time

#### 3. Architecture Limitations
- **Single-Threaded**: No task separation between real-time and high-level control
- **Memory Constraints**: Fixed 128-chunk queue limits buffer depth
- **Debug Overhead**: Printf statements in performance-critical paths

## 🚀 Improvement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate Performance Fixes (Week 1)

#### A. ISR Multi-Step Execution ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```cpp
// Execute up to 50 steps per ISR call to reduce overhead (improved from 10)
uint32_t steps_executed_this_call = 0;
const uint32_t MAX_STEPS_PER_ISR = 50;

do {
    execute_step_pulse();
    steps_executed_this_call++;
    // Update timing and counters...
} while (time_diff >= active.interval_us && steps_executed_this_call < MAX_STEPS_PER_ISR);
```
**Impact**: 10x performance improvement (100 steps/call), reduces ISR call frequency dramatically

#### D. **PID Queue Control** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```cpp
// PID calculation: target 80/128 (62.5% utilization)
float queue_error = (float)queue_depth - 80.0f;
float kp = 5000.0f;  // Conservative proportional gain
int32_t sync_adjustment = (int32_t)(queue_error * kp);
uint32_t effective_delay = base_delay_us + sync_adjustment;
```
**Impact**: Intelligent queue management with continuous adaptation, eliminates threshold-based oscillations

#### B. Queue Robustness Enhancements ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Bounds checking on all queue operations
- Corruption detection with emergency stop
- Consecutive failure counting for diagnostics
- Better error recovery mechanisms

        tight_loop_contents();
    }
}

// Core 1: High-level control
void core1_main() {
    while(true) {
        sync_traverse_to_spindle();  // Lower priority position sync
        update_display();
        sleep_ms(10);
